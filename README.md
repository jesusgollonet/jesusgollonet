### Hi, I'm Jesus Gollonet 👋

I'm a Technical Director and Software Engineer based in Málaga, Spain, with over 15 years of experience working on websites, apps, and interactive installations for global brands. I build things that blend technology, creativity, outdoors and fitness.

- 💻 Proficient in **backend development**, **Node.js**, **Typescript**, **devops** and **cloud infrastructure** (**Pulumi**, **Terraform**, **Docker**, **AWS**, **Google Cloud Run**)
- 🔧 Currently exploring **Python**, **computer vision** and **data science** after attending the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) last Summer
- 🌊 Working on a few prototypes to understand and detect swell and wave conditions using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Docker**
- 🛠 Passionate about optimizing workflows and building efficient, AI-assisted development pipelines

When AFK:
- 🚴 I’m a skateboarder, BMX rider, surfer, (and SUPper, and Skimboarder... the list keeps growing!) and love spending time outdoors with my family
- 🏕️ Recently discovered a love for Camping
- 🌍 Getting into Geography, Oceanography.
